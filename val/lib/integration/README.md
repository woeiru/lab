# Library Integration Test Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive test suite designed for mass function renaming operations across the `/lib` directory structure. The suite provides validation, safety mechanisms, and automation tools to ensure reliable large-scale refactoring.

## üìÅ File Overview

### Core Testing Modules

**`function_rename_test.sh`** - The primary validation engine that performs comprehensive testing of function dependencies, reference mapping, and integrity checking before and after mass function renaming operations. Discovers all 195+ functions across core, ops, and gen library categories and validates wrapper function relationships.

**`function_rename_enhancements.sh`** - Extended functionality module that adds CI/CD integration capabilities, performance benchmarking, Git workflow integration, and automated reporting in JSON/YAML formats. Complements the base testing module with modern DevOps practices.

### Execution and Safety Tools

**`batch_rename_executor.sh`** - Safe batch execution engine that implements the actual function renaming operations with comprehensive backup creation, validation at each step, and automatic rollback capabilities. Executes the planned rename batches with full safety measures.

**`preview_batch_renames.sh`** - Preview utility that displays exactly which functions would be renamed in each batch without making any changes. Shows the transformation from current names to proposed names across all three planned batches (core prefixes, operations suffixes, auxiliary functions).

### Documentation and Guidance

**`batch_rename_plan.md`** - Strategic planning document that defines the three-phase batch renaming strategy, explains the current naming conventions analysis, and outlines the implementation approach with safety measures and success criteria.

**`enhanced_features_guide.md`** - Complete documentation for the enhanced CI/CD integration features, including usage examples, output artifact descriptions, and workflow integration patterns for modern development environments.

**`implementation-summary.md`** - Final project status document detailing the complete implementation scope, best practices coverage matrix, and production readiness validation. Confirms all 195 functions are tracked and validated.

**`quick-reference.md`** - Concise command reference guide providing ready-to-use commands for all common scenarios, from basic validation to enhanced CI/CD integration, with clear examples and output locations.

### Demonstration

**`demo_enhanced_features.sh`** - Interactive demonstration script that showcases all enhanced features with timed examples, creates sample outputs, and validates the complete functionality of the enhanced testing capabilities.

## üéØ Purpose

This suite enables safe, validated, and automated mass function renaming across the entire library system while maintaining code integrity and providing comprehensive audit trails for enterprise development workflows.
