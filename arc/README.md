# Archive (`arc/`)

## 📋 Overview
Centralized archive storage for deprecated components, historical versions, and retired system configurations that may need future reference or restoration.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure / Key Files
**Currently Empty** - This directory serves as a staging area for archived materials as the system evolves.

Expected structure when populated:
- `components/` - Archived component implementations
- `configs/` - Historical configuration files
- `versions/` - Previous system versions
- `migrations/` - Migration scripts and documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Check archive contents
ls -la arc/

# Archive a deprecated component (when needed)
mv deprecated_component arc/components/
```
