# Lab Environment Setup

This is a modular environment setup system that provides a structured way to manage your shell configuration and system initialization.

## Quick Start

To set up your environment, run:

```bash
bin/env/inject
```

This will:
- Verify shell compatibility (Bash 4+ or Zsh 5+)
- Configure your shell environment
- Set up necessary directories
- Load required modules

## Directory Structure

- `bin/` - Executables and scripts
  - `env/` - Environment configuration tools
  - `core/` - Core system utilities
  - `depl/` - Deployment scripts
- `cfg/` - Configuration files
- `lib/` - Library modules
- `doc/` - Documentation
