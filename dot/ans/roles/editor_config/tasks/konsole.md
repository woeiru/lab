# Technical Documentation: konsole.yml

## Overview

This document provides technical details for the Ansible tasks defined in `konsole.yml`. These tasks set up Konsole profiles on a user's system. Konsole is the default terminal emulator for the KDE desktop environment.

## File Location

The `konsole.yml` file is located in the `tasks` directory of the `editor_config` role:

```
roles/
└── editor_config/
    └── tasks/
        └── konsole.yml
```

## Task Breakdown

The `konsole.yml` file contains the following tasks:

### 1. Ensure Konsole Directory Exists

```yaml
- name: Ensure .local/share/konsole directory exists
  file:
    path: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.local/share/konsole"
    state: directory
    mode: '0755'
```

This task creates the directory for storing Konsole profiles if it doesn't exist.

### 2. Create Konsole Profile

```yaml
- name: Create Konsole Profile
  copy:
    content: |
      [Appearance]
      ColorScheme=SolarizedLight
      Font=Noto Sans Mono,12,-1,5,400,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

      [General]
      Name=Profile 1
      Parent=FALLBACK/
      TerminalColumns=133
      TerminalRows=44
    dest: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.local/share/konsole/Profile 1.profile"
    mode: '0644'
```

This task creates a Konsole profile directly in the user's Konsole directory.

## Profile Customization

To customize the Konsole profile, modify the `content` section of the task. Here's a breakdown of the profile settings:

```yaml
[Appearance]
ColorScheme=SolarizedLight  # Change this to your preferred color scheme
Font=Noto Sans Mono,12,-1,5,400,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1  # Modify font settings as needed

[General]
Name=Profile 1  # Change the profile name
Parent=FALLBACK/
TerminalColumns=133  # Adjust the number of columns
TerminalRows=44  # Adjust the number of rows
```

You can add more profile-specific settings under the appropriate sections.

## Usage

To use these tasks:

1. Ensure the `konsole.yml` file is in the correct location within your Ansible role structure.
2. Include this file in your main tasks file (e.g., `main.yml`) using the `include_tasks` directive:

   ```yaml
   - name: Include Konsole configuration tasks
     include_tasks: konsole.yml
   ```

## Considerations

- These tasks assume that Konsole is installed on the target system.
- The tasks will run for the user specified by `ansible_env.HOME`.
- Existing profile files with the same names will be overwritten.
- You can add more tasks with different profile configurations if you need additional profiles.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that the user running the playbook has permissions to create directories and files in their home directory.
2. Ensure Konsole is installed on the target system.
3. Verify the syntax of the profile configurations within the `content` sections.
4. Run the playbook with increased verbosity (`-v` or `-vv`) for more detailed output.

For any persistent issues, consult the Konsole documentation or KDE community forums for specific configuration details.
