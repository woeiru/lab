# AI Resources Directory

This directory contains comprehensive resources for AI assistance across all aspects of development, operations, and analysis.

## üìç AI Resources Directory Position

The **`res/`** directory serves as the dedicated AI Resources hub within the lab, providing AI assistance across all lab operations, including:

- **Configuration Management** (`cfg/`) - AI-assisted configuration optimization
- **Documentation** (`doc/`) - AI-enhanced documentation generation and analysis  
- **Library Operations** (`lib/`) - AI-powered utility and function optimization
- **Source Code** (`src/`) - AI-assisted development and code generation
- **Testing** (`tst/`) - AI-driven test automation and validation

## üéØ Purpose

This directory serves as the central hub for all AI assistance capabilities, providing:

1. **Structured Prompt Libraries** - Reusable, tested prompt templates
2. **Workflow Automation** - AI-assisted task automation and orchestration
3. **Knowledge Management** - Curated information and context for AI systems
4. **Integration Resources** - Tools and configurations for AI service integration
5. **Analysis Frameworks** - AI-driven analysis and insight generation
6. **Optimization Tools** - Performance tuning and efficiency improvements

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the lab environment (if not already there)
cd lab/

# Initialize the entire lab environment
./entry.sh

# Initialize AI resources specifically
source res/ai/init.sh

# Use prompt templates
res/prompts/apply_template.sh <template_name> <parameters>

# Run AI-assisted workflows
res/workflows/execute.sh <workflow_name>

# Access knowledge base
res/knowledge/search.sh <query>

# Check system statistics
./stats.sh

# Access configuration management
source cfg/core/ecc

# Use library functions
source lib/core/err
source lib/ops/gpu
```

## üìã Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Follow established naming conventions and structure
2. **Documentation**: All resources must include comprehensive documentation
3. **Testing**: Validate prompt templates and workflows before deployment
4. **Version Control**: Maintain versioned prompt libraries and model configurations
5. **Security**: Ensure sensitive AI configurations are properly secured
