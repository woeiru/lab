5. **Analysis Frameworks** - AI-driven analysis and insight generation
6. **Optimization Tools** - Performance tuning and efficiency improvements

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize AI resources
source res/ai/init.sh

# Use prompt templates
res/prompts/apply_template.sh <template_name> <parameters>

# Run AI-assisted workflows
res/workflows/execute.sh <workflow_name>

# Access knowledge base
res/knowledge/search.sh <query>
```

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Follow established naming conventions and structure
2. **Documentation**: All resources must include comprehensive documentation
3. **Testing**: Validate prompt templates and workflows before deployment
4. **Version Control**: Maintain versioned prompt libraries and model configurations
5. **Security**: Ensure sensitive AI configurations are properly secured

## ðŸ”— Integration Points
