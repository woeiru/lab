# Temporary Workspace (`tmp/`)

## 📋 Overview
Working directory for temporary files, analysis documents, experimental code, and development artifacts that are not part of the permanent system structure.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure / Key Files
- `ana/` - Analysis documents and theoretical frameworks
- `fix/` - Bug fixes and troubleshooting documentation
- `flo/` - Workflow and process development files
- `how/` - How-to guides and implementation notes
- `net/` - Network-related temporary configurations and analysis
- `pro/` - Project-specific temporary files and prompts
- `too/` - Tool configurations and utilities

### Analysis (`ana/`)
- Infrastructure analysis series and frameworks
- Architectural theory and design documents
- Domain-first directory architecture research

### Fixes (`fix/`)
- Bug documentation and resolution steps
- System repair procedures and notes

### Workflows (`flo/`)
- Process development and workflow documentation
- Architecture diagrams and flow charts

### How-To (`how/`)
- Implementation guides and procedures
- Step-by-step configuration instructions

### Tools (`too/`)
- `acpi/` - ACPI configuration scripts and services
- `replace/` - Text replacement utilities and tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Create temporary analysis
mkdir tmp/ana/new_analysis
touch tmp/ana/new_analysis/notes.md

# Work on fixes
echo "Bug description" > tmp/fix/issue_description.md

# Develop workflows
touch tmp/flo/new_process.md

# Document procedures
touch tmp/how/setup_guide.md
```
