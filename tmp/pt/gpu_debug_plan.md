# GPU Passthrough Display Issue Debug Plan

## Problem Summary
- **Working Combination**: `gpu-ptd` (old) ‚Üí `gpu-pta` (old) ‚úÖ Display works
- **Broken Combination**: `gpu_ptd_w` (new) ‚Üí `gpu_pta_w` (new) ‚ùå Black screen
- **System**: Node x2, GTX 1650, nouveau driver

## Root Cause Analysis
The new enhanced functions include improvements (hardware reset + VGA console restoration) but something in the implementation changes is breaking display restoration. Need to isolate whether the issue is in:
1. **gpu_ptd_w** (detach process) 
2. **gpu_pta_w** (attach process)
3. **Combination of both**

## Debug Strategy: Isolation Testing

### Phase 1: Mixed Function Testing (CRITICAL)

**Test A: Old Detach + New Attach**
```bash
# Step 1: Reboot system (clean state)
reboot

# Step 2: Test mixed combination
gpu-ptd "0a:00.0"  # OLD detach function
# Run VM, then stop VM
gpu_pta_w "0a:00.0"  # NEW attach function

# Expected Result:
# - If display works: Problem is in gpu_ptd_w (new detach)
# - If display fails: Problem is in gpu_pta_w (new attach)
```

**Test B: New Detach + Old Attach**
```bash
# Step 1: Reboot system (clean state)
reboot

# Step 2: Test mixed combination  
gpu_ptd_w "0a:00.0"  # NEW detach function
# Run VM, then stop VM
gpu-pta "0a:00.0"   # OLD attach function

# Expected Result:
# - If display works: Problem is definitely in gpu_pta_w
# - If display fails: Problem is definitely in gpu_ptd_w
```

### Phase 2: Driver Selection Analysis

**Check Driver Differences**:
```bash
# What driver does old gpu-pta use?
grep -A10 -B5 "10de.*nouveau" /root/lab/tmp/pt/gpuold

# What driver does new gpu_pta_w use?
grep -A10 -B5 "_gpu_get_host_driver" /root/lab/lib/ops/gpu

# Force nouveau in new function if needed
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Comparison

**Key Differences to Investigate**:
1. **Driver Selection**: Old always uses `nouveau`, new has complex logic
2. **Binding Method**: Old uses direct bind, new uses `drivers_probe` + fallback
3. **Timing**: New has sleep statements, hardware reset delays
4. **Error Handling**: New has more validation steps

### Phase 4: Detailed Tracing (If Needed)

**Add Debug Output**:
```bash
# Modify gpu_pta_w to show exactly what driver it selects
# Add printf statements before each critical operation
# Compare exact sequence with working old version
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Test A Works, Test B Fails
- **Root Cause**: `gpu_ptd_w` (new detach) is the problem
- **Investigation**: Compare old vs new detach sequences
- **Likely Issues**: Driver unloading, binding method, device state

### Scenario 2: Test A Fails, Test B Works  
- **Root Cause**: `gpu_pta_w` (new attach) is the problem
- **Investigation**: Compare old vs new attach sequences
- **Likely Issues**: Driver selection, VGA console timing, hardware reset timing

### Scenario 3: Both Tests Fail
- **Root Cause**: Both functions have issues, or interaction problem
- **Investigation**: Systematic comparison of each function step-by-step

### Scenario 4: Both Tests Work
- **Root Cause**: Combination-specific issue when both new functions used together
- **Investigation**: Function interaction, shared state, timing conflicts

## Recovery Commands

**After Any Failed Test**:
```bash
# Manual VGA console restoration attempt
echo 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind 2>/dev/null
sleep 1  
echo 1 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind 2>/dev/null

# Manual PCI reset attempt
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:0a:00.0/reset

# If all fails: reboot to restore clean state
reboot
```

## Critical Test Commands

**Current Function Locations**:
- **Old Functions**: `/root/lab/tmp/pt/gpuold` (gpu-ptd, gpu-pta)  
- **New Functions**: `/root/lab/lib/ops/gpu` (gpu_ptd_w, gpu_pta_w)

**VM Management**:
```bash
# Start VM: qm start 111
# Stop VM: qm stop 111  
# Check VM status: qm status 111
```

**Status Monitoring**:
```bash
# Check GPU driver: lspci -nnk -s 0a:00.0
# Check VGA arbitration: cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:0a:00.0/boot_vga
# Check display: ls /dev/fb*
```

## Notes Section (Fill After Testing)

### Test A Results (gpu-ptd + gpu_pta_w):
```
Date: 2025-06-09 17:28  
Result: FAIL ‚ùå
Display Status: Black screen - vtcon0 unbound, console not displaying
Driver Status: nouveau driver bound correctly, /dev/fb0 exists
Notes: New attach function (gpu_pta_w) has display restoration issues
      - GPU binding works (nouveau active, boot_vga=1)
      - But VGA console restoration is incomplete
      - Problem is in gpu_pta_w VGA console logic
```

### Test B Results (gpu_ptd_w + gpu-pta):  
```
Date: 2025-06-09 17:38
Result: PASS ‚úÖ
Display Status: Working perfectly - vtcon0 rebound, console displaying
Driver Status: nouveau driver bound correctly, /dev/fb0 exists, boot_vga=1
Notes: New detach function (gpu_ptd_w) works fine with old attach
      - GPU binding works correctly
      - VGA console restoration is complete
      - Display is fully functional
```

### Root Cause Identified:
```
Problem Function: gpu_pta_w (new attach function)
Specific Issue: VGA console restoration logic in gpu_pta_w was incomplete
               - GPU binding works (nouveau loads, boot_vga=1, /dev/fb0 exists)
               - But vtcon0 remained unbound (stayed at 0 instead of 1)
               - Old gpu-pta function has no VGA console code but somehow works
Fix Applied: Enhanced VGA console restoration in gpu_pta_w
           - Added both vtcon1 (framebuffer) and vtcon0 (system) restoration
           - Proper sequence: vtcon1 first, then vtcon0
           - Better error handling and logging for each console type
```

### Fix Implementation:
```
Date: 2025-06-09 17:42
Location: /root/lab/lib/ops/gpu lines 1521-1548
Changes: Enhanced VGA console restoration logic
        - Restore vtcon1 (framebuffer console) first
        - Then restore vtcon0 (system console) for complete display
        - Added detailed logging for each step
        - Maintained proper timing (sleep 1) between unbind/rebind
Ready for: Final test with both new functions (gpu_ptd_w + gpu_pta_w)
```

### Final Test Results with Enhanced Fix:
```
Date: 2025-06-09 18:18-18:19
Test: gpu_ptd_w + gpu_pta_w (both new functions with VGA console fix)
Result: FAIL ‚ùå - Display still black
Details:
- GPU detachment: SUCCESS (gpu_ptd_w worked perfectly)
- VM start/stop: SUCCESS (VM ran properly with GPU passthrough)
- GPU reattachment: PARTIAL SUCCESS
  - Driver binding: SUCCESS (nouveau bound, /dev/fb0 exists)
  - VGA console restoration: FAILED (display remained black)
  - vtcon1: Restored but vtcon0 remained unbound (0)
Conclusion: VGA console manipulation is NOT the solution
```

## Phase 2: Minimal Function Approach

### Root Cause Analysis (Updated):
The problem is NOT VGA console restoration. The working old `gpu-pta` function has:
- **NO VGA console manipulation at all**
- **NO hardware reset**  
- **NO complex logging**
- **Simple driver binding sequence**

The new `gpu_pta_w` function added features that are BREAKING the display:
1. Hardware reset functionality
2. VGA console restoration attempts
3. Complex error handling and logging

### New Strategy: Strip Down to Minimal Working State

**Key Insight**: Preserve ONLY the flexible driver detection (needed for nvidia support on other nodes) while removing ALL enhancement features that could interfere with display.

### Minimal Implementation:
```
Date: 2025-06-09 18:20
Location: /root/lab/lib/ops/gpu lines 1499-1517
Changes: Stripped down gpu_pta_w to minimal state
        - Removed ALL VGA console manipulation
        - Removed hardware reset functionality  
        - Removed complex error handling
        - Kept ONLY flexible driver detection (_gpu_get_host_driver_parameterized)
        - Kept basic binding sequence: unbind ‚Üí clear override ‚Üí modprobe ‚Üí drivers_probe ‚Üí explicit bind
        - Matches working gpu-pta logic exactly, just with flexible driver selection
```

### Next Test Plan:
```
1. Reboot system (clean state)
2. Test: gpu_ptd_w + gpu_pta_w (minimal version)
3. Expected: Should work since it now matches old gpu-pta logic exactly
4. If successful: Problem was the enhancement features (VGA console/hardware reset)
5. If failed: Issue is in the flexible driver detection logic itself
```

### Minimal vs Enhanced Feature Comparison:
```
Working Old gpu-pta:
‚úÖ Vendor-based driver selection (1002=amdgpu, 10de=nouveau)
‚úÖ Basic binding: unbind ‚Üí clear override ‚Üí modprobe ‚Üí drivers_probe ‚Üí bind
‚ùå No nvidia driver support
‚ùå Fixed to nouveau for NVIDIA cards

New Minimal gpu_pta_w:
‚úÖ Flexible driver detection (supports nvidia/nouveau based on config)
‚úÖ Same basic binding sequence as working function
‚ùå Removed hardware reset (was breaking display)
‚ùå Removed VGA console manipulation (was breaking display)
```
