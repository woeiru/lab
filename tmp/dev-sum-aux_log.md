After the `aux_nos` to `aux_log` migration, the function is now used across:
- **8 operational library files**
- **25+ individual function calls**
- **Multiple operational contexts**: networking, user management, system operations, storage, virtualization

### Usage Patterns by Module

#### Network Operations (`lib/ops/net`)
```bash
aux_log "INFO" "$function_name: Network monitoring completed"
aux_log "ERROR" "$function_name: Failed to establish network connection"
```

#### User Management (`lib/ops/usr`)
```bash
aux_log "INFO" "$function_name: User account created successfully"
aux_log "ERROR" "$function_name: Invalid user configuration"
```

#### System Operations (`lib/ops/sys`)
```bash
aux_log "INFO" "$function_name: System backup initiated"
aux_log "WARN" "$function_name: System resources at 85% capacity"
```

#### Storage Operations (`lib/ops/sto`)
```bash
aux_log "INFO" "$function_name: Storage operation completed"
aux_log "ERROR" "$function_name: Insufficient disk space"
```

#### Virtualization (`lib/ops/pve`)
```bash
aux_log "INFO" "$function_name: VM deployment successful"
aux_log "ERROR" "$function_name: VM creation failed"
```

### Common Usage Patterns
1. **Success Logging**: `aux_log "INFO" "$function_name: operation completed successfully"`
2. **Error Reporting**: `aux_log "ERROR" "$function_name: specific error description"`
3. **Warning Messages**: `aux_log "WARN" "$function_name: warning condition detected"`
4. **Debug Information**: `aux_log "DEBUG" "$function_name: debug details"`

## Migration from aux_nos

### Historical Context
The `aux_log` function replaced the deprecated `aux_nos` function during a comprehensive codebase modernization effort. The migration was motivated by:
- **Consistency**: Align with existing logging conventions
- **Functionality**: Improve message formatting and timestamp handling
- **Maintainability**: Reduce redundant logging functions

### Migration Mapping
```bash
# Old aux_nos usage
aux_nos "$function_name" "operation completed"

# New aux_log usage  
aux_log "INFO" "$function_name: operation completed"
```

### Benefits Achieved
1. **Improved Categorization**: Log levels provide better message classification

   - `DEBUG`: Development and troubleshooting information

2. **Message Formatting**:
   - Include function name for context: `"$function_name: description"`
   - Use descriptive, actionable messages
   - Avoid sensitive information in log messages

3. **Error Handling Integration**:
   ```bash
   if ! some_operation; then
       aux_log "ERROR" "$function_name: Operation failed"
       return 1
   fi
   aux_log "INFO" "$function_name: Operation completed successfully"
   ```

### Integration Recommendations
1. **Consistent Usage**: Use `aux_log` for operational status reporting
2. **Complement Advanced Logging**: Use alongside `lib/core/lo1` for comprehensive logging
3. **Error Correlation**: Consider logging to both `aux_log` and error handling systems for critical failures
