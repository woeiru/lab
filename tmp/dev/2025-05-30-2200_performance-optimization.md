## Performance Analysis

### Key Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Function Registration (1.015s - 26% of total time)**
   - Individual function verification: 50-95ms per function
   - Individual function registration: 70-88ms per function
   - **Root cause**: Repetitive file I/O and module verification for each function

2. **Library Loading (1.651s - 43% of total time)**
   - LIB_OPS: 550ms, LIB_UTL: 512ms, LIB_AUX: 351ms, SRC_MGT: 338ms
   - **Root cause**: Sequential file sourcing and individual timer overhead

3. **Excessive Timer Overhead**
   - Timer operations for sub-50ms operations add measurable overhead
   - Frequent `tme_start_timer`/`tme_end_timer` calls with I/O operations

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Function Registration Optimization
**Target**: Reduce 1.015s to ~0.3s (70% improvement)

1. **Batch Module Loading**: Load each module once and cache function availability
2. **Eliminate Redundant Verification**: Cache verification results across functions
3. **Reduce Timer Granularity**: Use single timer for entire registration phase

### Phase 2: Library Loading Optimization  
**Target**: Reduce 1.651s to ~0.8s (50% improvement)

1. **Batch File Operations**: Group sourcing operations by directory
2. **Optimize Timer Usage**: Use meaningful timer granularity
3. **Cache File Existence Checks**: Reduce redundant file system calls

### Phase 3: I/O and Debug Optimization
**Target**: Reduce miscellaneous overhead by 30%

1. **Optimize Debug Logging**: Reduce file I/O frequency
2. **Cache Directory Creation**: Check and create directories once
3. **Streamline Verification**: Batch verification operations

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Function Registration Cache System

Created optimized function registration with module caching:
- Single module verification per module (not per function)
- Batch function availability checks
- Reduced timer granularity to meaningful operations

### 2. Enhanced Module Loading

Implemented batch file operations:
- Pre-verify file existence in batches
- Group timer operations for related tasks
- Cache module loading results

### 3. Debug Logging Optimization

Added performance mode to reduce I/O overhead during critical operations:
- Skip detailed debug logging during performance-critical sections
- Maintain essential logging for troubleshooting
- Reduce file writes during initialization

Reduced debug logging overhead:
- Batch log operations where possible
- Minimize file I/O frequency during critical paths
- Maintain full functionality while reducing overhead
