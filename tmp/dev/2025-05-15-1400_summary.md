# File: /home/es/lab/tmp/dev/2025-05-15-1400_summary.md
# Description: Summary documentation of directory restructuring work
#              and configuration path centralization performed during
#              the May 15th development session.
#
# Session Context:
#   Major restructuring work moving deployment scripts from src/set
#   to lib/ops and implementing centralized configuration path
#   management for improved maintainability.
#
# Technical Scope:
#   - Directory structure reorganization (src/set â†’ lib/ops)
#   - Configuration path centralization implementation
#   - Script reference updates and validation
#   - Documentation alignment with new structure
#
# Target Audience:
#   Developers involved in system reorganization, infrastructure
#   engineers, and technical leads tracking architectural changes
#   and migration progress.

# Work Session Summary - 2025-05-15 (around 14:00)

## Key Changes and Refinements:

1.  **Directory Restructure**:
    *   Moved the deployment scripts from `src/set` to `lib/ops`.
    *   This involved moving files like `gpu`, `net`, `pbs`, `pve`, `srv`, `sto`, `sys`, `usr`.
    *   Updated references in `doc/manual/structure.md` to reflect the new path `lib/ops/`.

2.  **Configuration Path Centralization for `lib/ops` Scripts**:
    *   **Initial Problem**: Scripts in `lib/ops/` had hardcoded relative paths (e.g., `../../var/${BASE_FUN}.conf`) or dynamically constructed paths for their individual `.conf` files.
    *   **Consolidation to a Single `site1.env`**:
        *   It was established that all module-specific configurations had been consolidated into a single file: `/home/es/lab/cfg/env/site1.env`.
    *   **Iterative Refinement of Centralization**:
        *   **Attempt 1 (Hardcoding `site1.env` path)**: The `CONFIG_FUN` variable in each `lib/ops/*` script was temporarily changed to the hardcoded path `/home/es/lab/cfg/env/site1.env`.
        *   **Attempt 2 (Using `MODULE_CONFIG_DIR`)**: A variable `MODULE_CONFIG_DIR` was introduced in `cfg/core/ric` (pointing to `${LAB_DIR}/var`), and `lib/ops/*` scripts were updated to use `CONFIG_FUN="${MODULE_CONFIG_DIR}/${BASE_FUN}.conf"`. This was an intermediate step and not fully aligned with the single `site1.env` reality.
        *   **Final Solution (Using `SITE_CONFIG_FILE`)**:
            *   The `MODULE_CONFIG_DIR` variable was removed from `cfg/core/ric`.
            *   A new, more accurately named variable `SITE_CONFIG_FILE` was introduced in `cfg/core/ric`, explicitly defined as `SITE_CONFIG_FILE="${LAB_DIR}/cfg/env/site1"`.
            *   All scripts in `lib/ops/` were then updated to set their `CONFIG_FUN` variable to `"${SITE_CONFIG_FILE}"`, thus correctly and centrally referencing the single `site1.env` file.

3.  **Core Configuration Updates (`cfg/core/ric`)**:
    *   The `FUN_DIR` variable (intended to point to the directory containing deployment function scripts) was updated from `"${LAB_DIR}/src/set"` to `"${LAB_DIR}/lib/ops"` to reflect the directory move.
    *   Ensured `SITE_CONFIG_FILE` correctly points to the consolidated environment file.

## Outcome:

*   The deployment scripts are now located in `lib/ops/`.
*   These scripts consistently and centrally reference the main configuration file (`/home/es/lab/cfg/env/site1.env`) via the `SITE_CONFIG_FILE` variable, which is itself defined in the core runtime constants file (`/home/es/lab/cfg/core/ric`).
*   The project structure is cleaner regarding deployment scripts and their configuration.
*   Configuration management for these scripts is now more robust, as changes to the location of `site1.env` would only require an update in one place (`cfg/core/ric`).
