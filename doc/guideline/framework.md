# Domain-First Directory Architecture: Theoretical Framework

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles
- **Domain Cohesion**: Related components stay together regardless of their technical type
- **Logical Grouping**: Organization reflects business/functional domains rather than technical categories
- **Hierarchical Context**: Each level of the hierarchy provides additional context
- **Feature Completeness**: All components of a feature reside within its domain
- **Semantic Organization**: Structure reflects meaning rather than implementation

### 1.2 Fundamental Concepts
1. **Domain Primacy**
   - Domains represent primary organizational units
   - Technical categories are secondary to business/functional domains
   - Domain boundaries align with natural feature boundaries

2. **Contextual Hierarchy**
   - Each directory level adds specific context
   - Deeper levels represent more specific functionality
   - Navigation follows logical reasoning patterns

3. **Semantic Relationships**
   - Directory structure reflects component relationships
   - Related features maintain proximity
   - Shared components have clear ownership

## 2. Architectural Layers

### 2.1 Primary Layer (Domain Level)
- Represents major functional areas
- Defines high-level system boundaries
- Establishes primary organizational context
- Examples: sys/, net/, app/, pro/

### 2.2 Secondary Layer (Feature Level)
- Contains complete feature sets
- Maintains feature independence
- Provides clear feature boundaries
- Represents discrete functional units

### 2.3 Tertiary Layer (Component Level)
- Organizes specific implementation components
- Maintains traditional directory categories
- Preserves technical organization within features

## 3. Organizational Patterns

### 3.1 Vertical Organization
1. **Domain Vertical**
   - Complete feature stacks within domains
   - Self-contained functionality
   - Clear ownership boundaries

2. **Feature Vertical**
   - All feature components together
   - Minimal cross-feature dependencies
   - Independent deployment capability

### 3.2 Horizontal Organization
1. **Cross-Domain Sharing**
   - Shared resource management
   - Common component organization
   - Standard interface definitions

2. **Layer Interaction**
   - Inter-layer communication patterns
   - Dependency management
   - Interface standardization

## 4. Architectural Considerations

### 4.1 Scalability Aspects
1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Adding new features within domains
   - Deepening feature functionality
   - Expanding component complexity

2. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Adding new domains
   - Expanding cross-domain functionality
   - Growing shared resources

### 4.2 Maintainability Factors
1. **Feature Isolation**
   - Clear component boundaries
   - Independent feature evolution
   - Simplified maintenance scope

2. **Change Management**
   - Localized modifications
   - Clear impact boundaries
   - Version control considerations

### 4.3 Access Patterns
1. **Navigation Logic**
   - Intuitive path finding
   - Logical component location
   - Clear organizational reasoning

2. **Resource Location**
   - Predictable file placement
   - Consistent naming patterns
   - Clear resource ownership

## 6. Trade-offs and Considerations

### 6.1 Structural Trade-offs
1. **Depth vs. Breadth**
   - Directory hierarchy depth
   - Cross-domain relationships
   - Navigation complexity
