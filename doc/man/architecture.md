## Architectural Principles

### Library Design Convention (`lib/`)
A fundamental principle for the `lib/` directory is that all scripts and functions must be **self-contained and stateless**. They avoid direct access to global variables or environment-specific configurations. Instead, any required external data, state, or configuration parameters must be passed explicitly as arguments. This approach enhances:
- **Modularity**: Functions can be used independently
- **Reusability**: Libraries work across different contexts
- **Testability**: Functions can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Dependencies are explicit and traceable

Scripts in directories like `src/set/` or `bin/` are responsible for sourcing necessary configurations (e.g., from `cfg/`) and passing them to the library functions.

### Environment-Aware Architecture
The system implements a **hierarchical configuration loading system**:
1. **Base Site Configuration**: Foundation settings in `cfg/env/site1`
2. **Environment Overrides**: Environment-specific modifications in `site1-dev`, `site1-w2`
3. **Node-Specific Settings**: Per-node customizations when applicable
4. **Runtime Constants Integration**: Centralized path management through `cfg/core/ric`

### Security-First Design
- **Zero hardcoded passwords**: All credentials managed through `lib/utl/sec`
- **Secure password generation**: Configurable length and complexity
- **Proper file permissions**: Sensitive files protected with 600 permissions
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful handling of missing credentials

## Key Components & Advanced Features

### Environment Setup and Initialization

-   **`entry.sh`**: Root-level symlink to `bin/env/rc` providing convenient access to environment setup.

    -   **Non-destructive modifications**: Creates reversible changes to shell config files.
    -   **Multi-shell support**: Compatible with bash and zsh environments.
    -   **Interactive and batch modes**: Supports `-y` (non-interactive), `-u`/`--user` (target user), `-c`/`--config` (config file).
    -   **Environment injection**: Automatically injects initialization code into `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
-   **`bin/init`**: Main initialization script automatically sourced after environment setup, providing core module loading.
