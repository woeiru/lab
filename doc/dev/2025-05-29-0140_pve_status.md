## 🎯 REFACTORING COMPLETED (2025-05-29)

### ✅ All Objectives Achieved

**TASK**: Restructure codebase to separate pure library functions from functions that use global variables

**COMPLETED WORK**:

1. **✅ Function Parameterization**: All 5 identified functions in `/home/es/lab/lib/ops/pve` successfully parameterized:
   - `pve-fun()` - accepts explicit `script_path` parameter
   - `pve-var()` - accepts explicit `config_file` and `analysis_dir` parameters  
   - `pve-vmd()` - accepts `hook_script` and `lib_ops_dir` parameters
   - `pve-vck()` - accepts `cluster_nodes_str` parameter
   - `pve-vpt()` - accepts all device parameters (8 total parameters)

2. **✅ Management Wrapper Functions**: Created `/home/es/lab/src/mgt/pve` with 5 wrapper functions:
   - `pve-fun-w()`, `pve-var-w()`, `pve-vmd-w()`, `pve-vck-w()`, `pve-vpt-w()`
   - All wrappers extract global variables and call pure functions
   - Maintains original function behavior for users

3. **✅ Component Orchestrator Updates**: Modified `/home/es/lab/bin/core/comp`:
   - Added `source_src_mgt()` function
   - Updated `setup_components()` to load management functions
   - Added proper error handling and logging

4. **✅ Configuration Updates**: Enhanced `/home/es/lab/cfg/core/ric`:
   - Added `SRC_MGT_DIR` definition following established patterns

5. **✅ Architecture Compliance**: 
   - Original three-letter convention names preserved in `lib/ops/`
   - Pure functions no longer depend on global variables
   - Clean separation between library (`lib/`) and application (`src/`) code
   - Wrapper functions provide seamless transition

6. **✅ Testing & Verification**:
   - Created comprehensive test script (`test_refactor.sh`)
   - Verified pure functions work with explicit parameters
   - Verified wrapper functions work with global variables
   - Confirmed component system loads both layers correctly

### 🏗️ Final Architecture

```
lib/ops/pve     →  Pure parameterized functions (no globals)
src/mgt/pve     →  Management wrappers (-w suffix, handle globals)  
cfg/core/ric    →  Directory definitions (SRC_MGT_DIR added)
bin/core/comp   →  Component orchestrator (loads both layers)
```

### 🎉 Mission Accomplished

**Result**: Successfully separated pure library functions from global variable management while maintaining backward compatibility and following established architectural patterns. The refactoring provides a clean foundation for testing, maintenance, and future development.

**Key Achievement**: Functions in `lib/ops/` are now pure and testable in isolation, while `src/mgt/` handles the global variable extraction layer, creating a clean separation of concerns that follows the project's architectural principles.
