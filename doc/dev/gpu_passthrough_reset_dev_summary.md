# GPU Passthrough Reset Development Summary

## Session Overview
Investigation and resolution of GPU passthrough reattachment issues, specifically addressing hardware state corruption after VM shutdown and GPU return to host.

## Problem Statement
After successful GPU passthrough detachment (`gpu_ptd_w`) → VM operation → VM shutdown → GPU reattachment (`gpu_pta_w`), the GPU would bind to nvidia driver but exhibit:
- Black screen (no display output)
- Fan stuck at full throttle
- VGA arbitration lost (`decodes=none`)

## Key Findings

### Enhanced Logging Analysis
- **lib/ops/gpu enhanced logging working perfectly** - provided detailed operation tracking
- Logging functions (aux_info, aux_business, aux_error) captured complete passthrough workflow
- GPU detachment: Both devices (3b:00.0 VGA, 3b:00.1 Audio) successfully unbound from nvidia/snd_hda_intel → bound to vfio-pci
- GPU reattachment: Main GPU (3b:00.0) successfully bound to nvidia, audio device (3b:00.1) failed to rebind

### Root Cause Discovery
1. **VGA Arbitration Loss**: `nvidia 0000:3b:00.0: vgaarb: VGA decodes changed: olddecodes=io+mem,decodes=none`
2. **Hardware State Corruption**: GPU hardware registers remained in passthrough-compatible state
3. **Thermal/Power Management Corruption**: Fan control stuck in emergency mode

### Solution Breakthrough
**PCI Function-Level Reset** resolved hardware state corruption:
```bash
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0/reset
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Fan control restored (no longer full throttle)
- ⚠️ Display still black (VGA arbitration not restored)
- ✅ GPU hardware state properly reset

## Technical Details

### Successful Operations
- GPU detachment with comprehensive logging (lib/ops/gpu:1272-1371)
- VM passthrough working correctly
- nvidia-smi communication maintained
- GPU hardware reset capability confirmed

### Remaining Issues
- VGA arbitration not restored (`boot_vga=1` but `decodes=none`)
- Display output still unavailable
- Audio device (3b:00.1) binding to snd_hda_intel needs enhancement

### Infrastructure Status
- IOMMU: ✅ Enabled
- VFIO modules: ✅ Loaded
- NVIDIA driver: ✅ Installed and functional
- Enhanced logging: ✅ Working excellently

## Next Steps - Phase 2: VGA Arbitration Restoration

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **VGA Arbitration Recovery**: Restore `decodes=io+mem` state after passthrough
2. **Console Rebinding**: Force VT console to rebind to restored GPU
3. **Display Pipeline Initialization**: Complete display subsystem restoration
4. **Audio Device Binding**: Fix nvidia driver binding for 3b:00.1

### Immediate Research Targets
1. **VGA Arbitration Manipulation**:
   - Investigate `/sys/kernel/debug/vgaarb/` interface
   - Test manual VGA arbitration lock/unlock sequences
   - Research kernel vga_switcheroo mechanisms

2. **Console Management**:
   - Explore VT console unbind/rebind via `/sys/class/vtconsole/`
   - Test framebuffer console restoration
   - Investigate DRM/KMS reinitialization

3. **Advanced Reset Methods**:
   - Secondary bus reset vs function-level reset
   - D3hot/D0 power state cycling
   - ACPI _RST method invocation

### Proposed Technical Solutions
1. **VGA Arbitration Force Recovery**:
   ```bash
   echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0/remove
   echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan
   ```

2. **Console Rebinding Sequence**:
   ```bash
   echo 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind
   echo 1 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind
   ```

3. **Enhanced Reset Sequence**:
   - PCI function reset ✅ (implemented)
   - + VGA arbitration restoration
   - + Console rebinding
   - + DRM subsystem reinitialization

### Testing Strategy
1. Test each solution component individually
2. Combine successful methods into enhanced gpu_pta_w
3. Validate complete passthrough cycle with display restoration
4. Document hardware state at each step

## Code Enhancement Required
**Target**: lib/ops/gpu gpu_pta_w function
**Addition**: PCI function-level reset step after driver binding
**Expected Impact**: Resolve hardware state corruption issues

## Current Session Progress (2025-06-09T02:24-02:32)

### Step 1: GPU Detachment - ✅ COMPLETED
**Timestamp**: 2025-06-09T02:24:50 - 2025-06-09T02:24:52
**Command**: `gpu_ptd_w`
**Status**: SUCCESS
**Log Location**: Enhanced logging active in lib/ops/gpu

**Details**:
- Both GPU devices successfully detached:
  - 3b:00.0 (VGA): nvidia → vfio-pci ✅
  - 3b:00.1 (Audio): snd_hda_intel → vfio-pci ✅
- VFIO modules loaded successfully
- Enhanced logging working perfectly
- Minor printf issue at line 1336 (cosmetic, not functional)

### Step 2: VM Startup - ✅ COMPLETED  
**Timestamp**: 2025-06-09T02:28:XX
**Command**: `qm start 111`
**Status**: SUCCESS - NO HANGING!
**VM Status**: running

**Details**:
- VM started without any system hanging issues
- Previous hanging problem resolved
- swtpm_setup message normal (TPM state preserved)

### Step 3: VM Shutdown - ✅ COMPLETED
**Timestamp**: 2025-06-09T02:28:XX
**Command**: `qm stop 111`
**Status**: SUCCESS

### Step 4: GPU Reattachment - ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS WITH NEW ISSUES
**Timestamp**: 2025-06-09T02:28:24 - 2025-06-09T02:28:30
**Command**: `gpu_pta_w`
**Status**: MIXED RESULTS

**Results**:
- ✅ Main GPU (3b:00.0): Successfully bound to nvidia driver
- ✅ PCI hardware reset: Completed successfully
- ✅ No system hanging (major improvement!)
- ⚠️ Audio device (3b:00.1): Failed to bind to nvidia driver
- ❌ **NEW ISSUE**: VGA arbitration not restored (`decodes=none`)
- ❌ **PERSISTENT**: Black screen (no display output)
- ⚠️ **REGRESSION**: Fan speed elevated (54% vs normal 39%)

**Detailed Analysis**:
1. **VGA Arbitration Issue**: `nvidia 0000:3b:00.0: vgaarb: VGA decodes changed: olddecodes=io+mem,decodes=none:owns=none`
2. **Boot VGA Status**: Device correctly identified as boot VGA (`boot_vga=1`)
3. **Driver Binding**: GPU bound to nvidia driver but not processing display
4. **Hardware Reset**: PCI reset executed but insufficient for display restoration

## New Understanding (2025-06-09T02:32)

### Root Cause Analysis - Deeper Issues
The PCI function-level reset resolved the **hardware state corruption** and **system hanging**, but **VGA arbitration** remains the core blocker for display restoration.

**Key Findings**:
1. **VGA Arbitration Loss**: After passthrough cycle, GPU loses VGA decode capabilities
2. **Console Binding**: VT console may not rebind to restored GPU
3. **Display Pipeline**: Hardware reset doesn't restore the complete display initialization chain

### Current Hardware State
- GPU Temperature: 29°C
- Fan Speed: 54% (elevated from normal 39%)
- Power Draw: 23.85W  
- Driver: nvidia (bound successfully)
- VGA Arbitration: **BROKEN** (`decodes=none`)
- Boot VGA: ✅ (correctly identified)
- Display Output: ❌ (black screen)

### Latest Session Progress (2025-06-09 Continued)

**BREAKTHROUGH**: PCI function-level reset **RESOLVED FAN ISSUE**
```bash
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0/reset
```
**Results**:
- ✅ **Fan speed normalized** (stuck fan resolved)
- ✅ GPU hardware state properly reset
- ❌ **Display still black** (VGA arbitration issue persists)

**Critical Finding**: PCI reset is **essential** for hardware state restoration after passthrough cycle.

### Code Status Update
**gpu_pta function**: ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTS PCI RESET** 
- Location: `/root/lab/lib/ops/gpu:1484-1501`
- Function correctly performs hardware reset after driver binding
- Reset logic working as designed to resolve fan/hardware state issues

## CURRENT SESSION STATE (2025-06-09 - CONTINUATION POINT)

### Exact System State RIGHT NOW
**Problem**: GPU passthrough cycle completed, manual PCI reset performed, but display still black
**GPU Status**: 
- Driver: nvidia (bound successfully)
- Hardware: Reset completed, fan normalized
- Display: Black screen (VGA arbitration broken)
- Command hanging: `nvidia-smi` hangs/times out

### What We Just Accomplished
1. ✅ **Confirmed PCI reset resolves fan issue** (`echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0/reset`)
2. ✅ **Verified gpu_pta already has PCI reset implemented** (lines 1484-1501)
3. ✅ **Updated documentation with current findings**

### NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION TO TEST
**Console Rebinding** - This is where we left off before potential system hang:
```bash
echo 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind
echo 1 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind
```

### IF SYSTEM HANGS DURING CONSOLE REBIND
**Recovery State**: System has GPU with corrupted VGA arbitration after passthrough
**Known Working**: PCI reset resolves hardware corruption but not display
**Resume Point**: Try alternative VGA arbitration restoration methods:
1. PCI remove/rescan sequence
2. VGA switcheroo mechanisms  
3. DRM subsystem reinitialization

### Alternative Recovery Commands (if console rebind fails)
```bash
# Method 1: PCI remove/rescan
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0/remove
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan

# Method 2: Check VGA switcheroo
ls /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/
cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch

# Method 3: DRM reinitialization (if available)
echo 1 > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/reset
```

**CRITICAL**: If testing causes hang, we are at the VGA arbitration restoration phase of troubleshooting.
