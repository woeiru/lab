# GPU Passthrough Reset Development Summary

## Session Overview
Investigation and resolution of GPU passthrough reattachment issues, specifically addressing hardware state corruption after VM shutdown and GPU return to host.

## Problem Statement
After successful GPU passthrough detachment (`gpu_ptd_w`) → VM operation → VM shutdown → GPU reattachment (`gpu_pta_w`), the GPU would bind to nvidia driver but exhibit:
- Black screen (no display output)
- Fan stuck at full throttle
- VGA arbitration lost (`decodes=none`)

## Key Findings

### Enhanced Logging Analysis
- **lib/ops/gpu enhanced logging working perfectly** - provided detailed operation tracking
- Logging functions (aux_info, aux_business, aux_error) captured complete passthrough workflow
- GPU detachment: Both devices (3b:00.0 VGA, 3b:00.1 Audio) successfully unbound from nvidia/snd_hda_intel → bound to vfio-pci
- GPU reattachment: Main GPU (3b:00.0) successfully bound to nvidia, audio device (3b:00.1) failed to rebind

### Root Cause Discovery
1. **VGA Arbitration Loss**: `nvidia 0000:3b:00.0: vgaarb: VGA decodes changed: olddecodes=io+mem,decodes=none`
2. **Hardware State Corruption**: GPU hardware registers remained in passthrough-compatible state
3. **Thermal/Power Management Corruption**: Fan control stuck in emergency mode

### Solution Breakthrough
**PCI Function-Level Reset** resolved hardware state corruption:
```bash
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0/reset
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Fan control restored (no longer full throttle)
- ⚠️ Display still black (VGA arbitration not restored)
- ✅ GPU hardware state properly reset

## Technical Details

### Successful Operations
- GPU detachment with comprehensive logging (lib/ops/gpu:1272-1371)
- VM passthrough working correctly
- nvidia-smi communication maintained
- GPU hardware reset capability confirmed

### Remaining Issues
- VGA arbitration not restored (`boot_vga=1` but `decodes=none`)
- Display output still unavailable
- Audio device (3b:00.1) binding to snd_hda_intel needs enhancement

### Infrastructure Status
- IOMMU: ✅ Enabled
- VFIO modules: ✅ Loaded
- NVIDIA driver: ✅ Installed and functional
- Enhanced logging: ✅ Working excellently

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Integrate PCI reset into gpu_pta_w function**
2. **Investigate VGA arbitration restoration methods**
3. **Enhance audio device binding logic**

### Future Research
1. VGA arbitration manipulation via sysfs
2. Alternative display restoration techniques
3. ACPI-based GPU reset methods

## Code Enhancement Required
**Target**: lib/ops/gpu gpu_pta_w function
**Addition**: PCI function-level reset step after driver binding
**Expected Impact**: Resolve hardware state corruption issues

## Session Impact
- **Major breakthrough** in understanding post-passthrough hardware state issues
- **Confirmed** enhanced logging system effectiveness
- **Identified** specific technical solution for hardware reset
- **Established** clear path for gpu_pta_w function improvement
