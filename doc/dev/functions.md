<!-- 
    This documentation focuses exclusively on generic pure functions from the lib/ folder.
    Pure functions are stateless, parameterized, and environment-independent.
    They provide predictable behavior and are fully testable with explicit inputs.
    
    The lib/ folder contains three categories of pure functions:
    - lib/core/  : Core system utilities (error handling, logging, timing)
    - lib/ops/   : Operations functions (infrastructure management)
    - lib/gen/   : General utilities (environment, security, infrastructure)

## üéØ Pure Function Characteristics

### Design Principles
- **Stateless**: No global state dependencies
- **Parameterized**: All inputs via explicit parameters
- **Predictable**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Testable**: Can be tested in isolation

### Usage Pattern
```bash
# Pure function call
function_name "param1" "param2" "param3"

# No environment variables required
# No side effects on global state
# Fully deterministic behavior
```

## üîß Integration

To use pure functions in your scripts:

```bash
# Source the required library modules
source "$LIB_CORE_DIR/err"
source "$LIB_OPS_DIR/pve"
source "$LIB_GEN_DIR/inf"

# Call functions with explicit parameters
pve-vmc "101" "node1,node2,node3"
handle_error "component" "message" "ERROR"
```
