## Domain Integration Guidelines

### Cross-Domain Communication
- Establish clear interfaces between domains
- Document domain dependencies
- Minimize cross-domain coupling
- Use standardized communication patterns

### Domain Hierarchy
```

├── core/         # Foundation level
├── depl/         # Infrastructure level
└── util/         # Support level

Service Domains
├── admin/        # Administration level
├── api/          # Interface level
└── mod/          # Extension level

Development Domains
├── test/         # Quality assurance level
└── dev/          # Development support level
```

### Best Practices

#### Domain Organization
1. Keep domains focused and single-purpose
2. Maintain clear boundaries between domains
3. Document domain responsibilities
4. Regular domain audits and cleanup

#### Domain Naming
1. Use descriptive, purpose-indicating names
2. Keep names short but meaningful
3. Use consistent naming patterns
4. Avoid overlapping domain names

#### Domain Management
1. Regular domain reviews
2. Clear ownership assignment
3. Documentation maintenance
4. Version control strategy

## Conclusion

The second dimension domain organization provides a powerful way to organize system components by their functional purpose. This organization:
- Improves system clarity
- Enhances maintainability
- Facilitates scaling
- Supports team collaboration
- Enables efficient system evolution

When implementing domain organization, remember to:
- Start with essential domains
- Add domains as needed
- Maintain clear documentation
- Regular review and refactor
- Keep domain purposes clear
