# 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code Documentation

Documentation for infrastructure teams and DevOps engineers managing deployment automation.

## 🎯 Target Audience

Infrastructure teams and DevOps engineers who need to:
- Implement standardized deployments using infrastructure utilities
- Manage environment-specific configurations and overrides  
- Extend deployment scripts with established automation patterns
- Orchestrate container and VM infrastructure at scale

## 📚 Documentation Index

### Infrastructure Management
- **[Infrastructure Guide](infrastructure.md)** - Comprehensive IaC deployment patterns, automation scripts, and infrastructure management
- **[Environment Management](environment-management.md)** - Multi-environment deployment patterns, configuration hierarchies, and automation

### Infrastructure Guidelines

#### Standardized Deployments
- **Infrastructure Utilities**: Use consistent deployment patterns for reliability
- **Container/VM Standardization**: 355+ lines of infrastructure utilities
- **Bulk Creation**: Colon-separated definition strings for rapid deployment
- **Configuration Validation**: Built-in validation and summary reporting

#### Environment Management
- **Environment-Specific Overrides**: Implement cascading configuration management
- **Multi-Environment Support**: dev, test, prod environment isolation
- **Node-Specific Settings**: Runtime configuration customization
- **Hierarchical Configuration**: base → environment → node cascade

#### Automation Patterns
- **Deployment Scripts**: Extend established patterns in `src/set/`
- **Service Orchestration**: Standardized service deployment automation
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Automated container and VM provisioning

## 🚀 Deployment Workflows

### Container Infrastructure
```bash
# Standardized container creation
source lib/utl/inf
define_containers "111:pbs:192.168.178.111:112:nfs:192.168.178.112"
validate_config && show_config_summary

# Set global defaults
set_container_defaults memory=4096 storage="local-lvm"

# Deploy with environment awareness
cd src/set/pve && ./pve q  # Create containers
```

### Proxmox VE Cluster Setup
```bash
cd src/set/pve
./pve a  # Configure repositories
./pve b  # Install packages  
./pve c  # Setup /etc/hosts
./pve d  # Generate SSH keys
```

### GPU Infrastructure Management
```bash
# GPU passthrough for infrastructure
gpu-pts-w    # Check GPU status
gpu-ptd-w 1  # Detach GPU for passthrough
gpu-pta-w 1  # Attach GPU back to host
```

## 🌍 Environment Management

### Configuration Hierarchy
```bash
# Environment configuration cascade
Base Configuration (cfg/env/site1)
    ↓
Environment Override (cfg/env/site1-dev)  
    ↓
Node-Specific Settings (runtime)
```

### Multi-Environment Deployment
```bash
# Development environment
export SITE="site1"
export ENVIRONMENT="dev"
export NODE="dev-node1"

# Production environment  
export SITE="site1"
export ENVIRONMENT="prod"
export NODE="prod-node1"
```

### Infrastructure Scaling
- **Multi-node cluster support** with QDevice integration
- **Automated IP management** and network planning
- **Storage backend flexibility** (Btrfs, ZFS, LVM)
- **Service replication** across cluster nodes

## 🔧 Infrastructure Utilities

### Core Infrastructure Functions
| Module | Purpose | Infrastructure Focus |
