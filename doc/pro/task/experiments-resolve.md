Resolve this experiment based on its outcome.

- Read the ## Success Criteria section in the experiment file.
  If that section is missing, stop and ask for success criteria before
  proceeding.
- Evaluate the experiment against those criteria.
- If promising: move to doc/pro/queue/, set Status: queue
- If not worth pursuing: move to doc/pro/dismissed/, set Status: dismissed,
  add ## Dismissal Reason, ensure filename ends with -plan.md
- Add ## Experiment Outcome section (what was learned, evidence)
- Report: destination path + outcome summary + what was learned
