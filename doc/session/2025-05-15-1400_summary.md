# Work Session Summary - 2025-05-15 (around 14:00)

## Key Changes and Refinements:

1.  **Directory Restructure**:
    *   Moved the deployment scripts from `src/depl` to `lib/depl`.
    *   This involved moving files like `gpu`, `net`, `pbs`, `pve`, `srv`, `sto`, `sys`, `usr`.
    *   Updated references in `doc/manual/structure.md` to reflect the new path `lib/depl/`.

2.  **Configuration Path Centralization for `lib/depl` Scripts**:
    *   **Initial Problem**: Scripts in `lib/depl/` had hardcoded relative paths (e.g., `../../var/\${BASE_FUN}.conf`) or dynamically constructed paths for their individual `.conf` files.
    *   **Consolidation to a Single `site.env`**:
        *   It was established that all module-specific configurations had been consolidated into a single file: `/home/es/lab/cfg/depl/site.env`.
    *   **Iterative Refinement of Centralization**:
        *   **Attempt 1 (Hardcoding `site.env` path)**: The `CONFIG_FUN` variable in each `lib/depl/*` script was temporarily changed to the hardcoded path `/home/es/lab/cfg/depl/site.env`.
        *   **Attempt 2 (Using `MODULE_CONFIG_DIR`)**: A variable `MODULE_CONFIG_DIR` was introduced in `cfg/core/ric` (pointing to `\${LAB_DIR}/var`), and `lib/depl/*` scripts were updated to use `CONFIG_FUN="\${MODULE_CONFIG_DIR}/\${BASE_FUN}.conf"`. This was an intermediate step and not fully aligned with the single `site.env` reality.
        *   **Final Solution (Using `SITE_CONFIG_FILE`)**:
            *   The `MODULE_CONFIG_DIR` variable was removed from `cfg/core/ric`.
            *   A new, more accurately named variable `SITE_CONFIG_FILE` was introduced in `cfg/core/ric`, explicitly defined as `SITE_CONFIG_FILE="\${LAB_DIR}/cfg/depl/site.env"`.
            *   All scripts in `lib/depl/` were then updated to set their `CONFIG_FUN` variable to `"\${SITE_CONFIG_FILE}"`, thus correctly and centrally referencing the single `site.env` file.

3.  **Core Configuration Updates (`cfg/core/ric`)**:
    *   The `FUN_DIR` variable (intended to point to the directory containing deployment function scripts) was updated from `"\${LAB_DIR}/src/depl"` to `"\${LAB_DIR}/lib/depl"` to reflect the directory move.
    *   Ensured `SITE_CONFIG_FILE` correctly points to the consolidated environment file.

## Outcome:

*   The deployment scripts are now located in `lib/depl/`.
*   These scripts consistently and centrally reference the main configuration file (`/home/es/lab/cfg/depl/site.env`) via the `SITE_CONFIG_FILE` variable, which is itself defined in the core runtime constants file (`/home/es/lab/cfg/core/ric`).
*   The project structure is cleaner regarding deployment scripts and their configuration.
*   Configuration management for these scripts is now more robust, as changes to the location of `site.env` would only require an update in one place (`cfg/core/ric`).
