# Work Session Summary - May 13, 2025

## TASK DESCRIPTION
The primary goal of this work session was to refine the logging behavior of the `/home/es/lab/bin/init` script. The existing output was often redundant or unclear. The objective was to implement a more controlled and informative logging system based on verbosity levels, and to document the script's overall functionality.

## COMPLETED ACTIONS

1.  **Analyzed Initial Script Output**:
    *   The `/home/es/lab/bin/init` script was executed to observe its default output and identify areas for improvement.

2.  **Reduced Redundant Logging**:
    *   Identified that `source` commands within the `init` script, when combined with `2> >(debug_log ...)` for error capture, were causing duplicate log entries.
    *   Modified these `source` calls in `/home/es/lab/bin/init` (specifically within `register_function`, `load_modules`, and `source_rc`) to redirect their `stderr` to `/dev/null`, thereby eliminating the redundant logs.

3.  **Implemented Verbosity Control**:
    *   Introduced a `DEBUG_VERBOSITY` variable in `/home/es/lab/bin/init`, defaulting to `1` (standard).
    *   Modified the `debug_log` function in `/home/es/lab/bin/init` to accept a `level` argument. This function now logs to a file (`/.log/debug.log`) unconditionally but only prints to `stderr` if the `DEBUG_VERBOSITY` is greater than or equal to the message's specified `level`.
    *   Updated calls to `debug_log` and various verification functions (e.g., `verify_module`, `verify_path`) throughout `/home/es/lab/bin/init` and the verification library `/home/es/lab/lib/core/ver` to pass appropriate verbosity levels.
    *   Refined `debug_log` for `DEBUG_VERBOSITY=0` (minimal) to only show messages to `stderr` containing critical keywords like "ERROR", "CRITICAL", "WARNING", or key lifecycle messages like "Starting main" or "completed successfully".

4.  **Created Wrapper Scripts for Verbosity Control**:
    *   **`/home/es/lab/bin/silent_init`**: A wrapper script that sets `DEBUG_VERBOSITY=0`. It further filters the `init` script's output using `grep` to provide a very clean summary, indicating only overall success or critical failures.
    *   **`/home/es/lab/bin/verbose_init`**: A wrapper script that sets `DEBUG_VERBOSITY=2` to enable maximum diagnostic output from the `init` script.
    *   Both wrapper scripts were made executable.

5.  **Tested Verbosity Levels**:
    *   The `init` script and the new wrapper scripts (`silent_init`, `verbose_init`) were tested with different `DEBUG_VERBOSITY` settings to confirm that the output behavior matched the new verbosity controls.

6.  **Summarized Script Functionality**:
    *   The initial version of this summary document was created to detail the functionality of the `init` script and the changes made during the session.

## RESULTING CODE STATE & CHANGES

### New Files:
*   **`/home/es/lab/bin/silent_init`**:
    *   Sets `DEBUG_VERBOSITY=0`.
    *   Pipes `/home/es/lab/bin/init` output through `grep` to filter for essential messages (startup, completion, critical errors) and suppress common warnings.
    *   Prints a custom success or failure message.
*   **`/home/es/lab/bin/verbose_init`**:
    *   Sets `DEBUG_VERBOSITY=2` to enable maximum logging from `/home/es/lab/bin/init`.
*   **`/home/es/lab/doc/session/work_session_summary_2025-05-13.md`**:
    *   This document, summarizing the work session.

### Modified Files:
*   **`/home/es/lab/bin/init`**:
    *   `DEBUG_VERBOSITY` variable introduced (default `1`).
    *   `debug_log` function updated to:
        *   Accept a `level` argument.
        *   Log to file always.
        *   Conditionally output to `stderr` based on `DEBUG_VERBOSITY` and message `level`.
        *   Filter messages for `stderr` when `DEBUG_VERBOSITY=0` to show only critical/key messages.
    *   Initial script echo `─── initializing` now includes the current verbosity level.
    *   Redundant logging from `source` commands (in `register_function`, `load_modules`, `source_rc`) removed by redirecting their `stderr` to `/dev/null`.
    *   Numerous `debug_log` calls updated to pass a verbosity level argument.
    *   Calls to verification functions (e.g., `verify_var`, `verify_function_dependencies`) updated to pass verbosity arguments.

*   **`/home/es/lab/lib/core/ver`**:
    *   Verification functions (`verify_path`, `verify_var`, `verify_module`, `verify_function_dependencies`, `verify_function`) updated to accept and use verbosity level arguments for their internal `debug_log` calls.
    *   Some nested verification calls within these functions had their `stderr` redirected or verbosity levels adjusted to reduce noise at lower global verbosity settings.

## PENDING ITEMS
*   None. The primary tasks for this session are complete.
