# Work Session Summary: 2025-05-14 ~05:20

**Primary Goal:** Diagnose and resolve a "plateau" effect observed in script log indentation. This issue was hypothesized to stem from the `lo2` shell script module (`/home/es/lab/lib/util/lo2`), which is responsible for tracking the depth of control structures (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`).

**Initial Problem Identified:** The `lo2` module was not producing any logs related to control structure entry or exit, despite being sourced. This pointed to potential problems with its `DEBUG` trap mechanism, internal logging, or premature script exit.

**Chronological Summary of Investigation & Actions:**

1.  **Initial Code Review & Context Gathering:**
    *   Reviewed `/home/es/lab/lib/util/lo1` (call stack logging module) to understand related logging mechanisms.
    *   Reviewed `/home/es/lab/lib/util/lo2` (control structure logging module), the primary focus of the investigation.
    *   Reviewed `/home/es/lab/lib/alias/dynamic` to understand the script execution context and how `lo2` might be invoked.

2.  **`lo2` Refactoring & Enhancements (Iterative):**
    *   **Deduplication Logic:** Modified `hash_command` and `track_control_depth` in `lo2` to use a more robust `LAST_COMMAND_SIGNATURE` (format: `source_file:line_number:command`) to prevent redundant processing of the same command instance.
    *   **Regex Refinements:** Improved regular expressions used to identify control structure keywords (e.g., `if`, `for`, `fi`, `done`).
    *   **`DEBUG` Trap Parameter Passing:** Updated `install_depth_tracking` to correctly pass `"$BASH_COMMAND"`, `"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"`, and `"${BASH_LINENO[0]}"` from the `DEBUG` trap's context to the `track_control_depth` function.
    *   **Trap Preservation:** Enhanced `install_depth_tracking` to better preserve any pre-existing `DEBUG` traps.

3.  **Log File Analysis (Post `init` Script Execution):**
    *   `/home/es/lab/.log/lo1.log`: Confirmed that `lo1` was active and logging call stack information.
    *   `/home/es/lab/.log/lo2.log`: Initially, this log only contained module loading messages (e.g., "Entering lo2 module initialization"). Crucially, it lacked any "Processing command," "Entered control structure," or "Exited control structure" messages, indicating `track_control_depth` was not functioning as expected.

4.  **Troubleshooting `lo2` Execution & `DEBUG` Trap Non-Firing:**
    *   **Direct Trap Fire Test:** Added a diagnostic `echo` statement at the beginning of the `track_control_depth` function in `lo2`, redirecting output to a new file (`/home/es/lab/.log/lo2_trap_fire.log`).
        *   **Result:** The `lo2_trap_fire.log` file was not created after running the `init` script, strongly suggesting that the `DEBUG` trap was not successfully invoking `track_control_depth`.
    *   **Internal Flow Diagnostics (Round 1):**
        *   To trace the execution flow within `lo2` itself, numerous `echo "LO2_FLOW: Point X..." >> "/home/es/lab/.log/lo2_flow_diag.log"` statements were strategically inserted throughout the `lo2` script.
        *   The `DEBUG` trap command within `install_depth_tracking` was simplified to a direct `echo` statement, also logging to `lo2_trap_fire.log`, to isolate trap setup issues from `track_control_depth` issues.
        *   **Result:** The `lo2_flow_diag.log` revealed that `lo2` was exiting prematurely. The script would execute initial `lo2_debug_log` calls at the beginning of the module but would terminate before reaching the global variable declarations (`declare -g ...`).

5.  **Pinpointing and Resolving Premature Exit in `lo2`:**
    *   **Granular Flow Markers:** More `LO2_FLOW` echo statements were added to further narrow down the exact point of exit.
    *   **`lo2_debug_log` Simplification:** The `lo2_debug_log` function itself was temporarily simplified to a basic `echo` to rule out complexities within the logging function as a cause. Initial calls to `lo2_debug_log` were also replaced with direct `echo` statements to a fallback log (`/tmp/lo2_fallback.log`) and then to `lo2_flow_diag.log`.
    *   **Global `declare` Statements Investigation:** The three global `declare` statements in `lo2` were suspected:
        *   `declare -g LOG_CONTROL_DEPTH_ENABLED=false`
        *   `declare -ga CONTROL_DEPTH_STACK=()`
        *   `declare -g LAST_COMMAND_SIGNATURE=""`
        These were systematically commented out and then uncommented one by one.
        *   **Result:** After a process of modification and restoration (specifically, ensuring all three `declare` statements were uncommented again), the script successfully executed past these declarations. The flow diagnostics confirmed execution up to "Point H" (a marker placed after all global declarations and before function definitions). The exact intermittent cause of the premature exit around the `declare` statements was not definitively isolated but appeared to be resolved by this iterative process of modification and testing. It's possible an earlier edit left the script in a transiently invalid state that was corrected.

6.  **Restoration and Verification of `lo2_debug_log`:**
    *   The `lo2_debug_log` function was restored to its more robust version (including timestamping and context).
    *   The initial diagnostic `echo` statements at the start of `lo2` were reverted to use the restored `lo2_debug_log` function.
    *   **Verification:** Execution of the `init` script confirmed that `lo2` now runs successfully past "Point H", and `lo2.log` contains the expected initialization messages logged by the restored `lo2_debug_log`.
    *   **Observation:** The `lo2_flow_diag.log` (before its diagnostic lines were removed from `lo2`) showed repeated blocks of initialization messages, suggesting that the `lo2` module might be sourced multiple times during the `init` script's execution. This is a potential area for future optimization but not the immediate blocker.

**Current Status (as of 2025-05-14 ~05:20):**

*   The `lo2` module (`/home/es/lab/lib/util/lo2`) now appears to initialize correctly, executing past global variable declarations and defining its functions.
*   The primary `lo2_debug_log` function is operational and logging as expected during the module's own initialization phase.
*   The `LO2_FLOW:` diagnostic echo statements have been removed from `lo2` as the immediate script execution issue up to "Point H" is resolved.
*   The `DEBUG` trap within `install_depth_tracking` is still in its simplified diagnostic state (direct `echo` to `/home/es/lab/.log/lo2_trap_fire.log`).

**Pending Next Steps:**

1.  **Verify `setlogcontrol "on"` Invocation:** Confirm that the main `init` script (or its equivalent) correctly calls `setlogcontrol "on"` *after* the `lo2` module has been sourced.
2.  **Test Simplified `DEBUG` Trap Firing:** Execute the `init` script and check if `/home/es/lab/.log/lo2_trap_fire.log` is created and populated by the simplified `DEBUG` trap. This will confirm the trap itself is being set and triggered.
3.  **Restore `DEBUG` Trap to Call `track_control_depth`:** If the simplified trap fires, modify `install_depth_tracking` in `lo2` to restore the `DEBUG` trap's command to call `track_control_depth "$BASH_COMMAND" "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" "${BASH_LINENO[0]}"`.
4.  **Investigate `track_control_depth` Logic:** If `track_control_depth` is successfully called by the restored trap, the next step will be to diagnose why it was not previously logging control structure entries/exits (e.g., issues with regex matching, stack manipulation, or conditional logic within `track_control_depth`).
5.  **Address Original Indentation Plateau:** Once `lo2` is correctly tracking and logging control depth, the original "plateau" effect in the main script logs can be properly investigated and addressed.
