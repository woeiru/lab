# Work Session Summary - 2025-05-13 04:00

## Goal
Resolve issues with the `init` script failing after the integration of the `comp` (component orchestrator) module. The failure point was identified as `setup_components` within `comp`.

## Key Activities & Findings:

1.  **Initial Analysis & Fixes:**
    *   Corrected error handler calls and a missing `end_timer` in `bin/core/comp`.
    *   Fixed `debug_log` in `lib/core/ver` to correctly output to stderr based on verbosity.
    *   Identified and corrected a typo in `lib/util/tme` (`LO_STATE_FILE` -> `LOG_STATE_FILE`). This resolved "No such file or directory" errors from `tme`.

2.  **Diagnosing `setup_components` Failure:**
    *   After the `tme` fix, `init` still failed with "ERROR: Component setup failed via orchestrator."
    *   Analysis of `bin/core/comp` revealed that `setup_components` was likely failing because its required sub-component `execution_rc` was failing.
    *   `execution_rc` attempts to call `set_static`, `set_dynamic`, and `set_aliaswrap`. These functions were not being sourced/made available.

3.  **Addressing Missing Alias Functions:**
    *   **Attempt 1 (Local Sourcing in `comp`):** Modified `execution_rc` in `bin/core/comp` to directly source the alias definition files (`lib/alias/static`, `lib/alias/dynamic`, `lib/alias/wrap`).
    *   **User Feedback & Refinement:** The user preferred a more centralized approach, managing these new functions and their sources via `cfg/core/rdc`, consistent with the existing architecture.
    *   **Attempt 2 (Centralized in `rdc` - Current State):**
        *   Updated `cfg/core/rdc` to include `set_static`, `set_dynamic`, and `set_aliaswrap` in `REGISTERED_FUNCTIONS`, their module paths (`lib/alias/static`, etc.) in `FUNCTION_MODULES`, and placeholder dependencies in `FUNCTION_DEPENDENCIES`.

## Resolution & Final Steps:

1.  **Reverted Local Sourcing:** The direct `source_helper` calls for the alias files were removed from `execution_rc` in `bin/core/comp`, relying on `cfg/core/rdc` for loading these.
2.  **Ran `init` Script:** Executed `/home/es/lab/bin/init` with the updated `rdc` and `comp` configurations.
    *   **Outcome:** The `init` script completed successfully. The `init_registered_functions` (via `rdc`) correctly sourced the alias definition files (`lib/alias/static`, `lib/alias/dynamic`, `lib/alias/wrap`), making `set_static`, `set_dynamic`, and `set_aliaswrap` available. Consequently, `execution_rc` and `setup_components` in `bin/core/comp` executed without errors.

## Final Status:
The `init` script is now working correctly. The integration of the `comp` module and the refactoring of alias function loading (managed centrally via `cfg/core/rdc`) have been successfully implemented.

## Pending Questions/Considerations:
*   Verify the actual dependencies for `set_static`, `set_dynamic`, and `set_aliaswrap` in `cfg/core/rdc` (currently assumed `err,lo1`).
