# Issue #001: GPU Passthrough Hook Trigger Bug

## Summary
VM shutdown hooks fail to trigger when VM is started via `pve_vms` orchestrator, but work correctly when started with direct GPU passthrough commands.

## Affected Components
- `pve_vms` function (lib/ops/pve:1314-1484)
- GPU passthrough hook system (pve_vmd)
- VM shutdown monitoring system

## Problem Description

### Scenario 1: Direct Command (Working)
```bash
./src/dic/ops gpu ptd -d lookup && qm start 111
# VM starts successfully
# VM shutdown from guest triggers hook correctly
# GPU reattaches to host as expected
```

### Scenario 2: Via pve_vms Orchestrator (Bug)
```bash
./src/dic/ops pve vms 111
# VM starts successfully through orchestrator
# VM shutdown from guest does NOT trigger hook
# GPU remains detached from host
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Environment Context Differences
- **Direct command**: Executes in full user environment with complete lab framework
- **pve_vms**: Runs through orchestrated workflow with different environment setup
- **Hook execution**: Runs in isolated systemd environment

### 2. Hook Setup Dependencies
The hook system requires:
- Proper hook registration via `pve_vmd add <vm_id> <lib_ops_dir>`
- Correct environment variable propagation
- Access to lab framework functions

### 3. State Management Conflicts
- `pve_vms` manages GPU state conditionally based on current attachment status
- Hook system expects specific GPU state transitions
- Timing differences between orchestrated startup and direct startup

## Technical Details

### pve_vms GPU Management (lib/ops/pve:1417-1439)
```bash
# Conditional GPU detachment based on current status
local gpu_status=$("$LAB_DIR/dic/ops" gpu pts 2>/dev/null | grep -o "ATTACHED\|DETACHED" | head -n1)
if [ "$gpu_status" = "ATTACHED" ]; then
    if ! "$LAB_DIR/dic/ops" gpu ptd -d lookup; then
        aux_warn "GPU detach operation failed, VM may not have GPU access"
    fi
fi
```

### Hook System (lib/ops/pve:957-1014)
```bash
# Hook wrapper with environment setup
cd /root/lab
export LAB_DIR=/root/lab
source bin/ini >/dev/null 2>&1
./go >/dev/null 2>&1
source "$LAB_DIR/lib/ops/gpu" && gpu_pta -d lookup
```

## Reproduction Steps
1. Ensure VM 111 exists and has GPU passthrough configured
2. Start VM using `./src/dic/ops pve vms 111`
3. Verify VM starts successfully
4. Shutdown VM from guest OS
5. Check GPU status - hook should trigger but doesn't

## Expected Behavior
- Hook should trigger regardless of startup method
- GPU should reattach to host after VM shutdown
- No difference between direct command and orchestrator startup

## Workaround
Use direct GPU passthrough command instead of pve_vms orchestrator:
```bash
./src/dic/ops gpu ptd -d lookup && qm start 111
```

## Investigation Status
- [x] Analyzed pve_vms function implementation
- [x] Identified environment and state management differences
- [x] Test hook registration when VM started via pve_vms
- [x] Verify environment variable propagation to hooks
- [x] Compare GPU state transitions between methods
- [x] Debug analysis completed - issue resolved

## Resolution
**Status: RESOLVED** - 2025-06-17

### Debug Findings:
The issue has been resolved. Current system verification shows:

1. **Hook Registration**: VM 111 properly configured with hookscript (`local:snippets/gpu-reattach-hook.pl`)
2. **Monitoring Active**: Systemd timer `vm-shutdown-monitor@111.timer` is active and functional
3. **Successful Operation**: Recent logs confirm working GPU reattachment:
   - `Mon Jun 16 11:14:56 PM CEST 2025: VM 111 shutdown detected (guest-initiated)`
   - `Mon Jun 16 11:14:56 PM CEST 2025: Executing GPU reattachment for VM 111 using DIC gpu pta`
   - GPU attachment process completed successfully

### Root Cause:
The original issue was that `pve_vms` function did not automatically register hooks when starting VMs with GPU passthrough, requiring manual hook registration via `pve_vmd add <vm_id> <lib_ops_dir>`.

### Current State:
- Both direct GPU passthrough commands and `pve_vms` orchestrator now work correctly
- Hook system properly triggers on VM shutdown regardless of startup method
- GPU reattachment executes successfully with proper environment setup

## Priority
**Resolved** - Core VM management functionality and GPU passthrough reliability restored

## Labels
- bug
- gpu-passthrough
- vm-management
- hook-system
- pve-orchestrator
- resolved

## Issue #001b: GPU Re-binding After Hook Execution

### Summary
Hook system successfully triggers and executes GPU reattachment, but GPU gets automatically rebound to vfio-pci after successful attachment to nouveau driver.

### Problem Description
**Sequence of Events:**
1. VM 111 started via `pve_vms` orchestrator (01:17:46)
2. VM shutdown detected by hook system (01:19:09) 
3. GPU reattachment executed successfully (01:19:11)
4. GPU bound to nouveau driver with "GPU attachment process completed"
5. **Issue**: GPU is currently bound to vfio-pci despite successful reattachment

### Evidence
**Hook Execution Logs (2025-06-17 01:19:11):**
```
GPU successfully bound to host driver [pci_id=0a:00.0,host_driver=nouveau,status=success]
GPU successfully bound to host driver [pci_id=0a:00.1,host_driver=nouveau,status=success]
GPU attachment process completed [status=complete]
```

**Current GPU State:**
```
$ lspci -k -s 0a:00.0
Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
```

### Root Cause Investigation Plan

#### Phase 1: Immediate State Analysis
- [ ] Check udev rules that might rebind GPU to vfio-pci
- [ ] Monitor GPU driver changes in real-time during next test
- [ ] Verify systemd services that might affect GPU binding
- [ ] Check kernel command line parameters for persistent GPU assignment

#### Phase 2: Timing Analysis  
- [ ] Measure time between successful reattachment and rebinding
- [ ] Check if rebinding happens immediately or after delay
- [ ] Identify what process/service triggers the rebinding

#### Phase 3: Process Identification
- [ ] Monitor system processes during GPU state changes
- [ ] Check for competing GPU management services
- [ ] Verify Proxmox VE services interaction with GPU states

#### Phase 4: Configuration Analysis
- [ ] Review complete system GPU passthrough configuration
- [ ] Check for conflicting GPU management configurations
- [ ] Verify boot-time GPU binding configuration

### Test Procedure
1. Start VM 111 via `pve_vms`
2. Monitor GPU state: `watch -n 1 'lspci -k -s 0a:00.0'`
3. Shutdown VM from guest
4. Observe GPU state changes in real-time
5. Identify exact moment of rebinding and triggering process

### Expected Resolution
- Identify the process/service causing automatic rebinding
- Prevent unwanted rebinding while preserving legitimate GPU management
- Ensure GPU remains attached to host after successful hook execution

### Priority
**High** - Hook system works but GPU doesn't remain available to host

### Labels
- bug
- gpu-passthrough  
- hook-system
- driver-binding
- follow-up
