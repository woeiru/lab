# Issue #001: GPU Passthrough Hook Trigger Bug

## Summary
VM shutdown hooks fail to trigger when VM is started via `pve_vms` orchestrator, but work correctly when started with direct GPU passthrough commands.

## Affected Components
- `pve_vms` function (lib/ops/pve:1314-1484)
- GPU passthrough hook system (pve_vmd)
- VM shutdown monitoring system

## Problem Description

### Scenario 1: Direct Command (Working)
```bash
./src/dic/ops gpu ptd -d lookup && qm start 111
# VM starts successfully
# VM shutdown from guest triggers hook correctly
# GPU reattaches to host as expected
```

### Scenario 2: Via pve_vms Orchestrator (Bug)
```bash
./src/dic/ops pve vms 111
# VM starts successfully through orchestrator
# VM shutdown from guest does NOT trigger hook
# GPU remains detached from host
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Environment Context Differences
- **Direct command**: Executes in full user environment with complete lab framework
- **pve_vms**: Runs through orchestrated workflow with different environment setup
- **Hook execution**: Runs in isolated systemd environment

### 2. Hook Setup Dependencies
The hook system requires:
- Proper hook registration via `pve_vmd add <vm_id> <lib_ops_dir>`
- Correct environment variable propagation
- Access to lab framework functions

### 3. State Management Conflicts
- `pve_vms` manages GPU state conditionally based on current attachment status
- Hook system expects specific GPU state transitions
- Timing differences between orchestrated startup and direct startup

## Technical Details

### pve_vms GPU Management (lib/ops/pve:1417-1439)
```bash
# Conditional GPU detachment based on current status
local gpu_status=$("$LAB_DIR/dic/ops" gpu pts 2>/dev/null | grep -o "ATTACHED\|DETACHED" | head -n1)
if [ "$gpu_status" = "ATTACHED" ]; then
    if ! "$LAB_DIR/dic/ops" gpu ptd -d lookup; then
        aux_warn "GPU detach operation failed, VM may not have GPU access"
    fi
fi
```

### Hook System (lib/ops/pve:957-1014)
```bash
# Hook wrapper with environment setup
cd /root/lab
export LAB_DIR=/root/lab
source bin/ini >/dev/null 2>&1
./go >/dev/null 2>&1
source "$LAB_DIR/lib/ops/gpu" && gpu_pta -d lookup
```

## Reproduction Steps
1. Ensure VM 111 exists and has GPU passthrough configured
2. Start VM using `./src/dic/ops pve vms 111`
3. Verify VM starts successfully
4. Shutdown VM from guest OS
5. Check GPU status - hook should trigger but doesn't

## Expected Behavior
- Hook should trigger regardless of startup method
- GPU should reattach to host after VM shutdown
- No difference between direct command and orchestrator startup

## Workaround
Use direct GPU passthrough command instead of pve_vms orchestrator:
```bash
./src/dic/ops gpu ptd -d lookup && qm start 111
```

## Investigation Status
- [x] Analyzed pve_vms function implementation
- [x] Identified environment and state management differences
- [x] Test hook registration when VM started via pve_vms
- [x] Verify environment variable propagation to hooks
- [x] Compare GPU state transitions between methods
- [x] Debug analysis completed - issue resolved

## Resolution
**Status: RESOLVED** - 2025-06-17

### Debug Findings:
The issue has been resolved. Current system verification shows:

1. **Hook Registration**: VM 111 properly configured with hookscript (`local:snippets/gpu-reattach-hook.pl`)
2. **Monitoring Active**: Systemd timer `vm-shutdown-monitor@111.timer` is active and functional
3. **Successful Operation**: Recent logs confirm working GPU reattachment:
   - `Mon Jun 16 11:14:56 PM CEST 2025: VM 111 shutdown detected (guest-initiated)`
   - `Mon Jun 16 11:14:56 PM CEST 2025: Executing GPU reattachment for VM 111 using DIC gpu pta`
   - GPU attachment process completed successfully

### Root Cause:
The original issue was that `pve_vms` function did not automatically register hooks when starting VMs with GPU passthrough, requiring manual hook registration via `pve_vmd add <vm_id> <lib_ops_dir>`.

### Current State:
- Both direct GPU passthrough commands and `pve_vms` orchestrator now work correctly
- Hook system properly triggers on VM shutdown regardless of startup method
- GPU reattachment executes successfully with proper environment setup

## Priority
**Resolved** - Core VM management functionality and GPU passthrough reliability restored

## Labels
- bug
- gpu-passthrough
- vm-management
- hook-system
- pve-orchestrator
- resolved

## Issue #001b: GPU Re-binding After Hook Execution

### Summary
Hook system successfully triggers and executes GPU reattachment, but GPU gets automatically rebound to vfio-pci after successful attachment to nouveau driver.

### Problem Description
**Critical Discovery (2025-06-17 01:31:36):**
The issue is that while the hook system executes successfully and reports successful GPU attachment to nouveau driver, the GPU gets automatically rebound to vfio-pci shortly after. This results in:
1. Hook system executes successfully and reports successful GPU attachment
2. GPU briefly binds to nouveau driver (confirmed in logs)
3. **However**: GPU gets automatically rebound to vfio-pci afterward
4. Display remains black and GPU is functionally unusable
5. Only solution is to use `gpu ptd` followed by `gpu pta` to restore functionality

**Comparison of Working vs Broken States:**

**Working Sequence (Normal Operation):**
```bash
./src/dic/ops gpu ptd -d lookup && qm start 111
# VM runs, shutdown from guest
# Hook executes, GPU successfully reattaches
# Display works, GPU available to host
```

**Broken Sequence (After pve_vms):**
```bash
./src/dic/ops pve vms 111
# VM runs, shutdown from guest  
# Hook reports successful execution
# GPU shows as bound to nouveau in logs
# Display remains black, GPU unusable
# Manual 'gpu pta -d lookup' also reports success but doesn't work
```

**Recovery Sequence (Only Working Fix):**
```bash
./src/dic/ops gpu ptd -d lookup
./src/dic/ops gpu pta -d lookup
# Display restored, GPU functional
```

### Evidence
**Hook Execution Logs (Multiple instances from 2025-06-16):**
```
17:52:28 - GPU successfully bound to host driver [pci_id=0a:00.0,host_driver=nouveau,status=success]
17:52:28 - GPU successfully bound to host driver [pci_id=0a:00.1,host_driver=nouveau,status=success]
17:52:28 - GPU attachment process completed [status=complete]

18:40:32 - GPU successfully bound to host driver [pci_id=0a:00.0,host_driver=nouveau,status=success]
18:40:32 - GPU successfully bound to host driver [pci_id=0a:00.1,host_driver=nouveau,status=success]
18:40:32 - GPU attachment process completed [status=complete]

21:41:56 - GPU successfully bound to host driver [pci_id=0a:00.0,host_driver=nouveau,status=success]
21:41:56 - GPU successfully bound to host driver [pci_id=0a:00.1,host_driver=nouveau,status=success]
21:41:56 - GPU attachment process completed [status=complete]
```

**Pattern Identified:**
Multiple successful hook executions show the GPU attachment process completes successfully, but the GPU gets automatically rebound to vfio-pci afterward by an external process or system configuration.

### Root Cause Analysis
**UPDATED DIAGNOSIS (2025-06-17):**

The issue is **NOT** in the `pve_vms` function as previously suspected. The root cause is an **automatic rebinding system** that rebinds the GPU to vfio-pci after successful hook execution.

**Key Findings**:
1. Hook system executes successfully and binds GPU to nouveau driver
2. GPU attachment process completes with success status
3. **External process** automatically rebinds GPU back to vfio-pci
4. This rebinding happens **after** hook completion but **before** user can use GPU
5. Timing suggests udev rules, systemd service, or kernel module configuration

**Evidence Analysis**:
- Multiple hook executions show identical pattern: success → automatic rebinding
- Hook logs show successful nouveau binding at exact timestamps
- GPU becomes unusable despite successful attachment reports
- Only manual `gpu ptd` → `gpu pta` cycle breaks the rebinding cycle

**System Suspects**:
1. **udev rules** that automatically bind GPU devices to vfio-pci
2. **Persistent device configuration** in `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/`
3. **systemd services** managing GPU state
4. **Kernel module** loading order or dependencies

### Root Cause Investigation Plan

#### Phase 1: Automatic Rebinding Investigation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Check udev rules that might rebind GPU to vfio-pci
- [ ] Monitor GPU driver changes in real-time during next test
- [ ] Verify systemd services that might affect GPU binding
- [ ] Check kernel command line parameters for persistent GPU assignment
- [ ] Measure time between successful reattachment and rebinding

#### Phase 2: System Configuration Analysis
- [ ] Examine `/etc/udev/rules.d/` for GPU-specific binding rules
- [ ] Check `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/` for persistent device IDs
- [ ] Analyze kernel module dependencies and loading order
- [ ] Review systemd unit files for GPU management services

#### Phase 3: Real-time Monitoring
- [ ] Set up continuous monitoring of GPU driver binding during hook execution
- [ ] Track system calls and kernel events during rebinding process
- [ ] Monitor dmesg/journal logs for automatic driver binding messages
- [ ] Implement timing analysis to identify exact rebinding trigger

#### Phase 4: Prevention Strategy Development
- [ ] Test blacklisting vfio-pci temporarily to confirm rebinding source
- [ ] Develop hook enhancement to prevent automatic rebinding
- [ ] Create persistent nouveau binding mechanism
- [ ] Test alternative GPU management approaches

### Test Procedure
**Controlled State Testing:**
1. **Baseline Test**: `gpu ptd` → `qm start 111` → shutdown → verify working
2. **Problem Test**: `pve vms 111` → shutdown → attempt `gpu pta` → verify broken  
3. **Recovery Test**: `gpu ptd` → `gpu pta` → verify working
4. **Hardware State Monitoring**: Monitor `/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:0a:00.0/` during each test

### Expected Resolution
- Identify the specific operation in `pve_vms` that corrupts GPU hardware state
- Implement proper GPU state cleanup/initialization in pve_vms workflow  
- Ensure GPU hardware remains in consistent state regardless of startup method

### Priority
**High** - Hook system works but GPU doesn't remain available to host
