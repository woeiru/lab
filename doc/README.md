### Writing Guidelines

#### Language and Style
- **Professional but approachable**: Technical accuracy without intimidation
- **Active voice**: "Configure the system" rather than "The system should be configured"
- **Direct and concise**: Eliminate unnecessary words
- **Inclusive language**: Use terms accessible to all skill levels

#### Technical Conventions
- **Code and filenames**: Use backticks: `filename.md`, `function_name()`
- **Commands**: Use code blocks with language specification
- **Emphasis**: Use **bold** for important concepts, *italics* for emphasis
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for unordered items, numbers for sequential steps
